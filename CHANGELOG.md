- Added observer, reflector, heartbeat, and context policy templates for controlled context compression

### Changed
- Updated `bin/install.sh` to preserve existing `wiki/tasks/` entries during category upgrades

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-16

### Added

### Changed
- Moved all product files into `it-support/` category directory
- Rewritten README for multi-category structure
- Updated `.ai/guidelines.md` with category awareness
- Updated `.ai/project/context.md` and `.ai/meta/structure.md` for category-based layout

### Removed
- Root-level agent entry point files (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, .junie/guidelines.md) — replaced with symlinks for dev use only
